# Star Wars Character Sheets

## Project Description

This project is based on Star Wars roleplaying game from fantasy flight games([Source](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/starwarsrpg/)). This eliminates the use of pencil and paper from play sessions, and you'll be able to digitize your character sheets and bring them anywhere you go. This is largely beneficial for sessions that rotate between remote sessions and in-person sessions.

Think Dungeons & Dragons character sheets, but translated for the use in Star Wars RPG.
